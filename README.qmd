**Tukutuku** is the ornamental lattice-work between upright slabs of the walls in a traditional Māori house that has a number of [traditional designs](https://teara.govt.nz/en/interactive/43489/types-of-tukutuku-designs).

I recently made a tukutuku panel using at kit from [Whatu Creative](https://www.whatucreative.com/) that came out really well, and was inspired to play with creating digital tukutuku.
